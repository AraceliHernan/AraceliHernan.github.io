        <p>My name is Araceli Hern√°ndez. I am a professor at the <a href="https://www.upm.es/" target="_blank">Polytechnic University of Madrid</a>, and I teach in the field of power systems.</p>
        
        <p>Most of my research has focused on the study of power quality in electrical systems. I also analyze the challenges arising from the conversion of generation based on electronic converters in distribution systems.</p>
        
        <p>I created this page to make my information and some of the work I produce accessible, but I am just getting started! So please be patient, as I will upload everything gradually.</p>
